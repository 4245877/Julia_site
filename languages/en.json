A failed first attempt pushed me toward a more ambitious goal: to build such a conversational partner from scratch. As the software foundation, I chose C++ — despite the appeal of Rust — as it allowed for precise control over resources and performance. An architectural plan was then devised for the system: components for speech generation, natural language processing, and emotion management. The AI is expected not only to initiate conversations but also to display a sense of dignity — for instance, by taking offense at rudeness or responding with humor. Its training will follow a model similar to raising an infant: introducing concepts about the world in stages, delivering knowledge in portions, and gradually building complex cognitive models. Ultimately, the system should develop human-like traits — individuality, reasoning ability, and the capacity to form its own beliefs — while maintaining virtually unlimited access to information.",
